# UX Portfolio

My name is Eric Galvan and am a Computer Science undergrad at California State University, Chico. I'm big into UI design and have always enjoyed that aspect of software dev, so  Usability Engineering will be an interesting exercise to see how much I really know. Reverse engineering, gaming, web development, 3D art are all techy hobbies I enjoy. I hope I am able to incorporate some of those areas into this portfolio!
